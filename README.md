# regular_expressions
* Two short python programs that iterate through lines of a text file and sums the total of digits interspersed throughout the text.
* re_ex_1.py is my solution for this exercise prompt: https://www.py4e.com/tools/python-data/?PHPSESSID=04f1ae20991a7fe54a3aa675df3e1e16
* re_ex_2.py is my attempt to accomplish the same end result by different means. I attempted to shorten the code used, when possible. 
  * In doing so, I learned quite a bit about generators!
